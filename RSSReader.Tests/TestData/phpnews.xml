        <description>The migration from CVS to Subversion is complete. The web interface is at svn.php.net. You can read about it at php.net/svn.php, wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq. The URL to feed to your svn client is http://svn.php.net/repository. There is also a github mirror. Please use that instead of trying to do a full git clone from the svn repository. See the instructions at wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq#git Many thanks to Gwynne who did the bulk of the work and also all the other folks who pitched in. It was a major effort to move 14 years of CVS history to another RCS.</description>

        <description>So finally we are at the end of the 2009 PHP TestFest. It has been an outstanding success with the coverage increasing by about 2.5% overall and 887 new tests contributed in the TestFest SVN repository of which 637 have already been added to PHP CVS. User groups from all over the world have worked hard to make this happen and we thank each and every one of you for your contribution to PHP! You really made a difference to the PHP5.3 release quality. There still are few loose ends to tie up - the TestFest SVN repository will be closed for contributions later this week and the last few tests will be moved into the main PHP repository. Finally, we have 10 elePHPants and 9 TestFest mugs to give out. The winners of mugs and elePHPants will be drawn at random from a list of people who wrote tests; the winner's names will be announced later this month. For those that would like to continue to make a difference by writing tests there are two options. You can simply continue by submitting new tests to the QA mailing list, or, if you have written a significant number of tests you might consider applying for your own PHP CVS (or SVN) ID. In your application you should reference the tests that you have written in support of your application. Last but not least, we would like to thank all of the companies and institutions that sponsored TestFest. These include Combell, Corretgé, Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia, IBM, iBuildings, Itera, Mayflower, Microsoft, Nexen (Alter Way Group), php|architect, Redpill-Linpro, Steinigke Showtechnic, Verges Council and Zend.</description>

        <description>TestFest is upon us once again. For those who don't know, this is the time of year where User Groups and individuals donate a little of their time and effort to increasing the test coverage of PHP. Hundreds of thousands of lines of code are working in concert to assemble one of the simplest to learn and fastest running scripting languages in the business. All this is achieved with the expectation that very few bugs will make it into releases and the ones that do will be stomped out quickly, efficiently and will never be heard from again. This is a lofty goal and is only possible through a system of tests designed to continuously evaluate the well-being of PHP. This year the QA Team has been very busy implementing new features and improvements to make the TestFest experience easier and more enjoyable than ever before. Some these improvements include a Subversion repository for test storage and tracking, a Virtual Machine for simple test environment setup, and improved documentation of testing procedures. 2009 is looking to be the most successful TestFest event ever. Over 20 User Groups spanning Belgium, Brazil, Catalonia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, USA and the UK have already registered. This is an incredible response and we still have 2 months left to go. Getting involved couldn't be simpler. Visit the QA TestFest page to find out how you can organize a TestFest event in your community. We are looking forward to seeing your communities tests being committed into PHP.</description>

        <description>The PHP development team is proud to announce the availability of the first release candidate of PHP 5.3.0 (PHP 5.3.0RC1). This release marks the final phase in a major improvement in the 5.X series, which includes a large number of new features, bug fixes and security enhancements.The key features of the PHP 5.3 branch include:Support for namespacesUnder the hood performance improvementsLate static bindingLambda functions and closures Syntax additions: NOWDOC, limited GOTO, ternary short cut "?:" and __callStatic() Optional garbage collection for cyclic referencesOptional mysqlnd PHP native replacement for libmysqlImproved windows support including VC6 and VC9 binariesMore consistent float roundingDeprecation notices are now handle via E_DEPRECATED (part of E_ALL) instead of the E_STRICT error levelSeveral enhancements to enable more flexiblity in php.ini (and ini parsing in general)New bundled extensions: ext/phar, ext/intl, ext/fileinfo, ext/sqlite3, ext/enchant Countless bug fixes and improvements to existing extensions in particular to: ext/openssl, ext/spl and ext/date This release also drops several extensions and unifies usage of internal APIs. Users should be aware of the following known backwards compatibility breaks:Parameter parsing API unification will cause some functions to behave more or less strict when it comes to type jugglingRemoved the following extensions: ext/mhash (see ext/hash), ext/msql, ext/pspell (see ext/enchant), ext/sybase (see ext/sybase_ct) Moved the following extensions to PECL: ext/ming, ext/fbsql, ext/ncurses, ext/fdf Removed zend.ze1_compatibility_modeSee the upgrading guide for other minor changesAll users of PHP, especially those using earlier PHP 5 releases are advised to test this release as the final release of PHP 5.3.0 will eventually obsolete the 5.2 branch of PHP.For users upgrading from previous PHP 5 releases there is an upgrading guide available here, detailing the changes between those releases and PHP 5.3.0.Please also note that we are aware of issues surrounding float/integer handling in some edge cases (some of which have been introduced in PHP 5.2.0), as well as a crash bug in NSAPI, that will be fixed in PHP 5.3.0RC2. These issues however do not prevent wide spread testing of PHP 5.3.0RC1 as users can now rely on the feature set and implementation decisions no longer being changed.For a full list of changes in PHP 5.3.0, see the CVS NEWS file.</description>

        <title>PHP 5.2.8 Released!</title>
        <link>http://www.php.net/index.php#id2008-12-08-1</link>
        <description>The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.2.8. This release addresses a regression introduced by 5.2.7 in regard to the magic_quotes functionality, which was broken by an incorrect fix to the filter extension. All users who have upgraded to 5.2.7 are encouraged to upgrade to this release. Alternatively you can apply a work-around for the bug by changing "filter.default_flags=0" in php.ini.</description>

        <description>Due to a security bug found in the PHP 5.2.7 release, it has been removed from distribution. The bug affects configurations where magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, because it remains off even when set to on. In the meantime, use PHP 5.2.6 until PHP 5.2.8 is later released.</description>
